# Psychologie und Gehirn (PuG) 2024

## Abstract

In the modern scientific landscape, systematic documentation and tracking of the evolution of digital objects are crucial for reproducible research and effective collaboration. Too often, chaotic workflows persist, especially against the backdrop of the replication crisis and increased demand for open science. It is in response to these challenges that the idea for a course emerged, aimed at providing master's students and doctoral candidates with a deeper understanding of version control.
The course was a full-semester elective offered at the University of Hamburg within the newly developed international master's program: Psychology M.Sc. (research).
It was called 'Effective Progress Tracking and Collaboration: An Introduction to Version Control of Code and Data.
For this course, we developed a learning resource titled "Version Control of Code and Data," an online book guide. It's open-source and available on GitHub. Additionally, we shared quizzes and all slides in GitHub repositories, contributing to open educational resources. 
Five master students and one Ph.D. student participated in the course. Throughout the course, they utilized the provided book as a guide and applied Git to track changes in an example repository. The feedback received was very positive, we e.g. received four nominations for the Teaching Award of the University of Hamburg. indicating a successful learning experience. As a result, the course is scheduled to be repeated next semester.
We've also established an ongoing commitment to continuously enriching our online resources. These resources will undergo regular expansion to ensure they remain dynamic and responsive to evolving needs and advancements in the field.

## "Elevator-pitch"

So many phd students and researchers struggle with organizing their analysis code, doesn´t matter if it is written in R, Python, Matlab or in which language.
A lot of scientists do not have a good solution to recover older versions and collaborate efficiently with others.
Even though there is a very good solution to manage code,the tool Git,  which is the goldstandard in the computer science industry and has been for many years,.
As sciences like psychology get more and more intertwined with informatics we need to teach effictive mangement of code to the researchers of the futures.
Thats why we organized this course: "Version control of Code and Data" last semester in the new psychology research master. 
We created an online guide to teach Git from scratch to students who don´t have previous knowledge of computer science and are not in the typical target group of Git
To lead by example, we used GitHub to share our learning materials, including our guide, our slides and quizzes,
That means everybody can use them and we hope the guide will be a "living ressources" with people adding content.

We got great feedback by our students and are happy to say that the course will be repeated next semester!
